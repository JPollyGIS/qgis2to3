subsetString:>>>:==General change== was made const. This has no effect on PyQGIS code, but c++ code implementing derived layer classes will need to update the signature of this method to match.

createJoinCaches:>>>:==General change== has been removed. Caches are created/updated when needed internally.
checkJoinLayerRemove:>>>:==General change== has been removed. Joins are removed internally when joined layer is deleted.
readXml:>>>:==General change== does not resolve references to joined layers. Call resolveReferences() when joined layers are available.
snapWithContext:>>>:==General change== , snapToGeometry() - last argument has changed from QgsSnapper::SnappingType to QgsSnappingResult::SnappingType (no change in functionality).
snapPoint:>>>:==General change== has been removed - use QgsPointLocator class instead.
snapWithContext:>>>:==General change== has been removed - use QgsPointLocator class instead.
insertSegmentVerticesForSnap:>>>:==General change== has been removed - use addTopologicalPoints() directly.
addFeature:>>>:==General change== no longer accepts an alsoUpdateExtent boolean - this extra argument has been ignored for some time
addFeatures:>>>:==General change== no longer accepts a makeSelected boolean, and will not automatically select newly added features. If desired, features must be manually selected by calling selectByIds() after addFeatures()
annotationForm:>>>:==General change== and setAnnotationForm() have been removed. Form path is stored in individual QgsFormAnnotation objects.
hasGeometryType:>>>:==General change== has been removed, replaced by QgsMapLayer::isSpatial()
addRing:>>>:==General change== now returns QgsGeometry::OperationResult enum, integer representation of returned values may have changed

cache:>>>:==General change== has been removed.
hasError:>>>:==General change== was renamed to errorCode()
readXml:>>>:==General change== does not resolve layer IDs to layers anymore. You need to call resolveReferences() afterwards.
cache:>>>:==General change== has been removed.
writeAsVectorFormat:>>>:==General change== now takes a QgsCoordinateTransform reference, not a pointer. An invalid QgsCoordinateTransform should be used instead of a null pointer if no transformation is required.
